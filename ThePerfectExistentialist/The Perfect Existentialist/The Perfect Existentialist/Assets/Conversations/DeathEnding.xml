		<Node ID="3perfect">You simply don't fall into any of the categories we have to define the perfect existentialist. You are a failure! You'll never create harmony!<Options>

		<Node ID="4definition">Existentialism is broken into three parts, based on the three ancient novels we've meticulously studied.<Options>
				<Option jumpTo="4def1">Okay.</Option>
			</Options>
		</Node>
		
		<Node ID="4def1">First, existentialists are loyal to those who create them, like Gregor Samsa is loyal to his parents and boss.<Options>
				<Option jumpTo="4def2">But doesn't Gregor let himself die for people who do not care about him?</Option>
			</Options>
		</Node>
		
		<Node ID="4def2">Second, existentialists are cynical and apathetic towards things they don't like, like Meursault who does not care about his mother at all.<Options>
				<Option jumpTo="4def3">But isn't it his right to choose what is important to him? Who are we to judge?</Option>
			</Options>
		</Node>
		
		<Node ID="4def3">Thirdly, existentialists must be insistently proud of themselves, like Stephen Dedalus who arrogantly turns away everything to seek out his artistic passions.<Options>
				<Option jumpTo="5perfect">But isn't Stephen lost in the end? Searching for a meaning to his life after he renounces all that he was taught?</Option>
			</Options>
		</Node>
		
		<Node ID="5perfect">No! No! NO! You're wrong and we're right! Accept that you are a failure so we can destroy you!<Options>
				<Option jumpTo="6perfect">Your world is meaningless to me! I can make my own path and you can't stop me!</Option>

		<Node ID="6perfect">But don't you want to make HARMONY! We made you what you are, insolent Slime. You owe us everything.<Options>
